This is a Spotify Web App following a Spotify-esque stylistic design. Currently, all users must have their spotify account approved by me to access the web app. If you
would like to see how it works please email me at nathan84dona@knights.ucf.edu so I may approve you. I have submitted a proposal to Spotify which would remove the 
authorization barrier and allow this app to serve all the people that need it, however this process can take months. If approved I'll edit this README to include a link
to the web app. For now please enjoy the uploaded demo video, and thank you for stopping by! :)
